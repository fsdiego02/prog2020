/* m011.c - Count words.

   This program takes the name of an ASCII text file passed as a command 
   line argument, and outputs the number of words in this file. A word is 
   a sequence of alphabetic characters delimited by blanks. A sample text 
   file i011.txt is provided for convenience (should you desire to test with
   another text file, make sure it is in pure ASCII format, not UTF-8 or 
   other milti-byte format.

   E.g.

      command line    : m011 i011.txt
      expected output : 98

   Directions:

      Please, edit function wordcount();
      do no not change function main().
